# Proxy
This is the newly developed Inferris player data architecture that works with the REST API microservice. Includes just some of the features.
This was made public, and will be merged into the actual BungeeCord proxy plugin.
This will likely be kept up for the time being as an old source to get a timelapse of how our architecture has improved.
